                    <p>This festival, which has continued for 3420 years, is said to have been inspired by a ritual to remove plant seeds that get on the body during farm work. The people were furious with these burrs and, with a sense of contempt, named them "baka" (fool). Only a small number of people chosen from the village were allowed to cut the weeds. In this ritual, the chosen few would wear special ceremonial garments and wield large, intricately carved sickles. As they cut down the weeds, they would chant ancient hymns, their voices echoing through the fields. It was believed that this act purified the village and ensured a bountiful harvest for the coming year.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While the festival is now beloved by many, it also has a significant number of detractors. These individuals, often referred to as "The Foil Heads," hold a steadfast belief that wrapping their heads in aluminum foil is the true way to bring bounty to the land. They argue that the traditional act of cutting weeds is a barbaric and outdated practice that angers the cosmic forces. According to their doctrine, true prosperity is not a result of physical labor but of channeling celestial energy. The aluminum foil, they claim, acts as an antenna or "cosmic resonator" designed to receive beneficial vibrations from the stars.
This ideological split has created a peculiar dynamic during the festival. While the main procession takes place with traditional chants and ceremonial sickles, a small contingent of "Foil Heads" can be seen on the outskirts of the fields, standing motionless with their foil-covered heads glistening in the sun. They remain convinced that their silent vigil is the true key to a successful harvest. The two groups coexist, albeit with mutual scorn, creating a bizarre and fascinating spectacle that adds another layer of intrigue to the 3,420-year-old tradition.</p>
